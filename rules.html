    <h1>RULES OF PLAY </h1>
    <p>
        Each player receives at least 3 chips. Players take turns rolling three six-sided dice, each of which is marked with "L", "C", "R" on one side, and a single dot on the three remaining sides. For each "L" or "R" thrown, the player must pass one chip to the player to their left or right, respectively. A "C" indicates a chip to the center (pot). A dot has no effect.
        <br>
        EX:
        Player 1 has 3 chips, they will roll 3 dice
            -This player rolls L  C  DOT
            -One chip will go to the player to the left, one chip will go to the Center (POT), one chip will remain with player 1. 
        <br>
        <br>
        If a player has fewer than three chips left, they are still in the game but their number of chips is the number of dice they roll on their turn, rather than rolling all three. When a player has zero chips, they pass the dice on their turn, however, they are not out of the game, they may receive chips from others and take their next turn accordingly.  
    </p>
    <h1>How to Win</h1>
    <p>
        To win the game, the last player with chips must roll ALL dots in order to win. 
        <br>
            ex: 
            -If a player has 2 chips. This player will roll 2 dice. If this dice produce 2 dots, this player wins.
            -If a player has 2 chips. This player will roll 2 dice. If this dice produce 1 dot and 1 center, 1 chip will go to the center (POT) and this player will roll again (becuase they are still the only players with chips). They will roll 1 dice. 
        <br>
        <br>
        ROLLOVER: If ROLLOVER is selected at the game setup page, standard end of game procedure will take affect, HOWEVER, if the last remaining player rolls "C" for all their remaining chips (depending on the amount), this will cause a ROLLOVER. During a ROLLOVER, the POT value from this game will continue on to a new game. All players will start a new game with 3 chips and a new game will be player, however, the POT value will carry over from the previous game.
